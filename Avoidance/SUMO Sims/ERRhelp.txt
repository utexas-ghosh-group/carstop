Please add problems you've had getting this to run (on any OS), and a solution if you found one.
Thanks!

ImportError: No module named traci    --->    the tools directory in the constants.py file is not being found correctly.

something something no file found    --->    your SUMO commands can't be found or are named differently
...	i.e. for Windows 64 the commands are named "sumo64.exe" instead of "sumo.exe"
...	change the names in constants.py


IOStream has no fileno    --->    use command line instead of editor / Spyder

Err 302: Broken Pipe   --->  this happens to me occasionally.  I don't know what the cause is, if it happens repeatedly just log out/restart.
